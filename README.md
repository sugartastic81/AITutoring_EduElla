# AITutoring_EduElla

## Overview

**AITutoring_EduElla** is an advanced AI-driven educational chatbot designed to enhance the learning experience for students. EduElla leverages a multiformat Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to process various educational resources, including PDFs with tables and images, and stores them in an edge-ready Vector Database. The chatbot utilizes compact Large Language Models (LLMs) that can run efficiently on edge devices, making it a scalable and accessible solution for educational institutions.

## Key Features

- **Edge-Ready Deployment**: Utilizes an edge-ready Vector Database and small, efficient models that can run on standard hardware, including smartphones and notebooks.
- **Personalized Tutoring**: Adapts to individual learning styles and paces, providing customized support and guidance.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Employs advanced contextualization techniques to deliver relevant and accurate answers.
- **Open Source**: Built with open-source technologies to ensure accessibility, transparency, and community-driven improvements.
- **Sustainability**: Designed to be resource-efficient, enabling widespread deployment without significant hardware requirements.

## Functionality
